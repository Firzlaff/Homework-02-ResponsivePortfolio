      I was born in St. Helena Hospital, lake County Califorina, April 30th 1987, I grew up in Cobb Califorina until moving to Sandy Utah when i was in Kindergarten. I love the outdoors and living on the Wastach Mountian range. Most my live I have lived on the mountian skiing, I truely belive when they say that Utah has the best snow on earth that it is 100% equiviacally the truth. Skiing through our powder with no consequence drops is a rush like none other, explaining to people the feeling of drowning in waist high snow flowing over your whole body engulfing you as begin making your first turns decending the mountian, that feeling when you float to the top and break through the beautiful air and sun, ridiing the wave of snow down incredible steeps feeling like your floating through a cloud of goose down feathers of cold. Not only did I ski but Mountian Biking, hiking, and trail running also occupy 
      much of my summers. Utah feels special with also have Moab and the Red Rock just south of us offering another beautiful landscape for outdoor fun. Lately I do not get out as much as I am spending more time expanding my knowledge of Tech/PC/Coding world. I have always been facinating by programing and the creating that can be done with computers. When I do find myself outside its generally hiking going on walks playing pokemongo or doing a Spartan Race.

      At a young age I realised I had a passion for all electronics and tech, this with gamming and the outdoors have been all my passions and hobbies for the past 25 years. I would consider myself a "Gamer" I have been known to play pokemongo for for extremely long and crazy sessions with 96 hours straight played as my record. This was lvl 39-40 without going to sleep. I also love math and the statics that come with gaming, I can break things down into fun numbers ie. that 96 hour playing session was 5 million xp that is an average of 52,083.33 per hour every hour. Thinking about the fact you only get 100xp per pokemon catch. Now i ran a lucky egg doubling my XP most likely the whole time. and a Great Curveball. first throw Catch can earn up to 360xp. Not to mention doing a legendary raid provides 20,000xp with the lucky egg.
